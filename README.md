2. Interactive Output: Each time a user runs the command "wow", the text is displayed in a new color, adding an element of surprise and making the reading process more enjoyable.

3. Creativity and Entertainment: The application can be used for entertainment purposes, such as during demonstrations, training, or in games where visual effects play a significant role.

4. Increased Speed of Changes: Enhances the speed of making modifications by allowing users to quickly locate specific sections, reducing the time spent scrolling or searching through the file. 

5. Facilitates Team Collaboration: Numbering helps in discussing changes with colleagues, streamlining the collaborative process.
